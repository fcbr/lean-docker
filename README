Dockerfile that creates an environment for the Lean Theorem Prover

https://github.com/leanprover/lean

I had to create this to run Lean on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine.

To run it, you need to put a public ssh key on the current directory,
named id_rsa.pub.  Once the container is running, just ssh -Y <IP> and
execute /root/lean/bin/leanemacs_build
