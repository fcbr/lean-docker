Dockerfile that creates an environment for the Lean Theorem Prover

https://github.com/leanprover/lean

Quick and dirty hack to run the latest Lean on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
system.

To run it, you need to put a public ssh key on the current directory,
named id_rsa.pub.  Once the container is running, just 
ssh -Y -l root <IP> and execute /root/lean/bin/leanemacs_build (although YMMV)
